Allows shoppers to send messages & inquiries about a product/order and allows sellers to manage messages from within the WordPress dashboard

== Description ==
This extension allows shoppers to be able to send different types of messages to the shop owner (seller) directly from their Individual Account page. The types of messages include; product-related messages, order-related messages, refund-related messages, and dispute-related messages. The shop owners are also alerted by email on receiving new messages from shoppers.

It also allows shoppers to be able to inquire about a listed product before purchasing. In most cases, shoppers would like to know just a little more about a product before making up their minds to purchase an item. This plugin provides a means to let your shoppers inquire about a product directly from the product page, giving the shop owner a chance to land a sale!

This extension also provides a helpdesk interface for shop owners to manage messages directly from their WordPress dashboard. Each message sent from shoppers are handled as tickets by the shop owners and moved across different status until resolved. It also allows tickets to be assigned to different users.

The extension also allows the shop owner (seller) to manage their messages/orders from other helpdesks like Zendesk, Freshdesk, and others. Shop owners can now connect their store messages to one helpdesk of their choice and manage tickets/messages from their helpdesk.

This extension supports multi-languages and can fit right into different types of WooCommerce stores.

== Installation ==
Setup and Configuration

On the first installation of the extension, shop owners would need to complete the installation wizard

To start the installation wizard, go to WooCommerce > Settings > Inbox Tab

Once the installation wizard is started:

Step 1: Sign in Or Sign up to Inbox for WooCommerce.

New users would be required to create an account to start using the inbox for the WooCommerce extension. Registration is free and simple, with most fields already prefilled with information from the WordPress platform. If the user already has an account, the user should complete the sign-in process instead.

Step 2: Select where to manage tickets/messages

The shop owner would need to select where to manage tickets/messages. The default location for handling is the WordPress admin dashboard. However, users can choose to manage from helpdesks like Zendesk or Freshdesk.

Please Note: If a helpdesk is selected, the store owners would need to validate their helpdesk accounts to link it with the store

Step 3: Personalize your settings. The final step would be to personalize your store\'s \"Inbox for WooCommerce\" settings, by selecting which features would be running on your store.

Once the setup wizard is completed, your Inbox for WooCommerce is ready to go!

By default, the extension is enabled on installation completion.
